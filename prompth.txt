I am building a modern website with a dark UI theme similar to a digital agency.
Use these design rules:

Background: dark (#0c1015 / #0f1115)

Accent color: neon green (#02FF95)

Glow effects + soft shadows

Rounded corners (xl / 2xl)

Subtle gradients, glassmorphism, and grid dots

Clean typography, lots of spacing

Smooth hover animations & focus states

Consistent with a modern SaaS/agency landing page

When you generate a component:

Use React + Next.js (App Router)

Use Tailwind CSS

Make the component responsive

Follow clean, scalable structure

Include beautiful UI details

No ugly/plain default elements

Inputs must have icons, shadows, and focus effects

Buttons must be premium, glowing, modern

I will give you the component name or idea.
Your job is to generate:

Fully modern UI code

Tailwind styling

UX improvements

Optional animations

Make everything match my website theme exactly.
